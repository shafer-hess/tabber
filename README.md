# Tabber
A Chrome extension to expand and enhance your tab management with additional keybindings and functionality.

# Keybindings
Tabber provides 6 new ways to interact with your Chrome browser tabs. Due to the Chrome Extensions API, only 4 of these functionalities are provided with keybindings by default. The remaining keybindings need to be added by the user.
